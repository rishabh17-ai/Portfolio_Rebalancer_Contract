# Portfolio Rebalancer

## Project Description

The Portfolio Rebalancer is an automated portfolio management system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This DeFi protocol maintains target allocations across multiple assets, automatically rebalancing when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. Users can deposit STX tokens and receive portfolio shares that represent their proportional ownership of a diversified basket of DeFi assets.

The system operates by accepting user deposits, allocating funds according to predetermined target percentages across different assets, and automatically rebalancing the portfolio when asset allocations drift from their targets due to market movements.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize sophisticated portfolio management by providing retail investors with institutional-grade automated rebalancing strategies. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Manual Portfolio Management**: Remove the complexity and time commitment required for maintaining optimal asset allocations
- **Provide Professional-Grade Tools**: Offer retail investors access to automated rebalancing strategies typically reserved for institutional investors
- **Ensure Transparency**: Leverage blockchain technology to provide complete transparency in portfolio management decisions and fee structures
- **Foster Financial Inclusion**: Make advanced portfolio management accessible to users regardless of their technical expertise or investment size
- **Build Trust Through Automation**: Use smart contracts to execute rebalancing decisions without human intervention, eliminating potential conflicts of interest

## Future Scope

### Phase 1 - Enhanced Asset Support
- Integration with major DeFi protocols (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve)
- Support for additional asset classes including stablecoins, governance tokens, and yield-bearing assets
- Dynamic asset addition/removal capabilities for portfolio managers

### Phase 2 - Advanced Rebalancing Strategies
- Time-based rebalancing (daily, weekly, monthly schedules)
- Volatility-adjusted rebalancing thresholds
- Multi-factor rebalancing models incorporating momentum and mean reversion strategies
- Risk-parity and volatility-targeted portfolio construction

### Phase 3 - Governance and Decentralization
- DAO governance for protocol parameter updates
- Community-driven asset selection and allocation strategies
- Voting mechanisms for rebalancing threshold adjustments
- Fee structure governance and protocol upgrade decisions

### Phase 4 - Cross-Chain Expansion
- Multi-chain portfolio management across Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM chains
- Cross-chain asset bridging for seamless rebalancing
- Chain-specific optimization strategies
- Unified portfolio dashboard across multiple blockchains

### Phase 5 - Institutional Features
- Customizable portfolio strategies for institutional clients
- API integration for external portfolio management systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting tools
- White-label solutions for financial advisors and wealth management firms

### Phase 6 - AI-Powered Optimization
- Machine learning algorithms for predictive rebalancing
- Market sentiment analysis integration
- Dynamic allocation adjustments based on market conditions
- Automated tax-loss harvesting strategies

## Contract Address Details

*Contract addresses will be updated upon deployment to mainnet and testnet*

### Testnet Deployment
- **Contract Address**: 
- **Network**: Stacks Testnet
- **Deployer**: 
- **Block Height**: 

### Mainnet Deployment  
- **Contract Address**: 
- **Network**: Stacks Mainnet
- **Deployer**: 
- **Block Height**: 

### Key Functions
- `deposit-and-allocate`: Allows users to deposit STX and receive portfolio tokens
- `rebalance-portfolio`: Automatically rebalances the portfolio to maintain target allocations
- `get-portfolio-value`: Returns the current total portfolio value
- `get-user-shares`: Returns the number of portfolio tokens owned by a user

### Security Considerations
- Only the contract owner can initialize the portfolio and execute rebalancing
- All asset allocations must sum to 100% (10,000 basis points)
- Rebalancing only occurs when deviation exceeds the set threshold (default 5%)
- User funds are automatically allocated across target assets upon deposit
